# Testing the Invite System

## Quick Summary of Fixes

âœ… **Fixed band detail page query** - Corrected foreign key relationship syntax
âœ… **Improved "already a member" messaging** - Better alerts when user is already in the band
âœ… **Added detailed console logging** - Easy to debug issues

## Why You're Seeing "Already a Member"

You're currently logged in as the band owner/member. When you click your own invite link, the system correctly detects you're already in the band and prevents duplicate membership.

## How to Test the Full Invite Flow

### Option 1: Sign Out and Create New Account (Recommended)

1. **Sign out** of your current account
   - Go to Settings or Profile tab
   - Click "Sign Out"

2. **Click the invite link** (from clipboard or wherever you saved it)
   - You'll see the invite preview screen
   - Band name and details will be displayed

3. **Click "Create Account & Join"**
   - Fill out the signup form
   - After signup, you'll automatically join the band

4. **Success!** You'll be redirected to the band detail page as a new member

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Browser Window

1. **Copy the invite link** from your main browser/app
2. **Open an incognito/private window** (or different browser)
3. **Paste the invite link** in the URL bar
4. **Create a new account** through the invite flow
5. **Verify the new user is added** to the band

### Option 3: Use a Different Device

1. **Copy the invite link**
2. **Email or message it** to yourself
3. **Open on another device** (phone, tablet, different computer)
4. **Create a new account** there
5. **Test the full onboarding flow**

### Option 4: Use Another Email Account

1. **Sign out** of your current account
2. **Use a different email** to create a test account
3. **Click the invite link**
4. **Sign in with the test account**
5. **Accept the invitation**

## Complete Test Scenario

### Step 1: Create an Invite (As Band Owner)

1. Navigate to your band's detail page
2. Click the **UserPlus icon** in the top-right header OR click **"Invite Member"** in the Members tab
3. Configure invite options:
   - Max uses: 1 (for single use test)
   - Expires: 7 days
   - Leave email blank
4. Click **"Create Invite Link"**
5. **Copy the link** (or use Share button)

### Step 2: Test as New User

1. **Sign out** of your account
2. **Open the invite link** in your browser
3. You should see:
   - "Band Invitation" title
   - Band name and description
   - "Create Account & Join" button (primary)
   - "Sign In to Join" button (secondary)

4. **Click "Create Account & Join"**
5. Fill out the signup form:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: testuser@example.com
   - Password: testpass123
   - Confirm Password: testpass123

6. **Submit the form**
7. After signup, you should:
   - See "Welcome!" alert
   - Be automatically added to the band
   - Be redirected to the band detail page

8. **Verify membership**:
   - You should see yourself in the Members tab
   - You should have "member" role
   - Dashboard should show the band

### Step 3: Test with Existing User

1. **Sign out** of the test account
2. **Sign in with a different existing account** (create one if needed)
3. **Open the same invite link** (if multi-use) or create a new one
4. You should see the invite preview screen
5. **Click "Accept Invitation"** (since you're already logged in)
6. You should be added to the band immediately

### Step 4: Verify Invite Limits

1. **Create a single-use invite** (max uses: 1)
2. **Use it to add a member**
3. **Try using the same link again**
4. Should see: "This invitation has already been used"

## Expected Console Output

When accepting an invite, you should see:
```
[acceptInvitation] Starting with token: <uuid> userId: <uuid>
[acceptInvitation] Validation result: { valid: true, invitation: {...} }
[acceptInvitation] Invitation details: { band_id: "...", ... }
[acceptInvitation] Existing member check: { existingMember: null, memberCheckError: {...} }
[acceptInvitation] Adding new member to band
[acceptInvitation] Updating invitation usage
[acceptInvitation] Successfully accepted invitation
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Already a Member" when testing
**Solution**: You're testing with the same account that's already in the band. Sign out and create a new account.

### Issue: "Invalid invitation token"
**Solution**:
- Check that the `band_invitations` table exists in Supabase
- Verify the token in the URL matches one in the database
- Check if the invite has expired

### Issue: Band members query fails
**Solution**: The foreign key relationship might need adjusting. Check your database schema for the exact foreign key name.

### Issue: Nothing happens when clicking "Accept"
**Solution**: Check the console for detailed error logs. Look for database errors or RLS policy issues.

## Database Verification

To verify invites are created properly, check your Supabase database:

```sql
-- View all invitations
SELECT * FROM band_invitations;

-- View invitation with band details
SELECT
  bi.*,
  b.name as band_name
FROM band_invitations bi
JOIN bands b ON bi.band_id = b.id;

-- Check band members
SELECT
  bm.*,
  p.name as member_name,
  b.name as band_name
FROM band_members bm
JOIN profiles p ON bm.user_id = p.id
JOIN bands b ON bm.band_id = b.id;
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Band owner can create invite links
âœ… Invite links can be copied and shared
âœ… New users can sign up through invite link
âœ… Existing users can sign in through invite link
âœ… Users are automatically added to the correct band
âœ… Single-use invites are consumed after first use
âœ… Multi-use invites can be used multiple times
âœ… Expired invites show appropriate error message
âœ… Already-member users see friendly message
âœ… Band member list updates after invite acceptance

## Need Help?

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the console logs** - Look for `[acceptInvitation]` messages
2. **Verify database table** - Ensure `band_invitations` table exists
3. **Check RLS policies** - Make sure they're configured correctly
4. **Review TypeScript types** - Regenerate if schema changed
5. **Clear app cache** - Sometimes helps with stale data

Happy testing! ðŸŽ‰
